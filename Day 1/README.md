# Fibonaci Series
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence is 0, the
second number is 1 and the nth number is the sum of the (n - 1)th and (n - 2)th numbers. Write a
function that takes in an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number.
Important note: the Fibonacci sequence is often defined with its first two numbers as F0 = 0 and
F1= 1. For the purpose of this question, the first Fibonacci number is F0; therefore, getNthFib(1) is
equal to F0, getNthFib(2) is equal to F1, etc..

# Product Sum
Write a function that takes in a "special" array and returns its product sum.
A "special" array is a non-empty array that contains either integers or other
"special" arrays. The product sum of a "special" array is the sum of its
elements, where "special" arrays inside it are summed themselves and then
multiplied by their level of depth.

 # Permutations
Write a function that takes in an array of unique integers and returns an
array of all permutations of those integers in no particular order.
If the input array is empty, the function should return an empty array.
